This folder contains a pipeline and intermediate steps of the presented analyses. The vertlife_mammaltree.txt and cleanmaninalnddf.RData are input datasets on mammalian phylogeny and range sizes, respectively. The dataset cleanmaninalnddf.csv is identical as the cleanmaninalnddf.RData, just turned into a human-readable text format. The R scripts named Fig* and SupFig* generate the crude versions of the main and supplementary figures presented in the manuscript. In some cases (e.g. Fig3*), separate panels of the figure are generated separately. The function and logic behing the upstream scripts and processed datasets is explained in the code comments.
