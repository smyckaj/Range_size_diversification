This folder contains a pipeline and intermediate steps of presented analyses. The vertlife_mammaltree.txt and cleanmaninalnddf.RData are input datasets on mammalian phylogeny and range sizes, respectively. These data are used by medianSecSSEmodel*.R scripts that launch different secsse models and generate their parameter estimates in medianSecSSEmodel*.RData files. Model iii estimates are further used for estimating and plotting the tip rates of diversification in scripts tipsmedianSecSSE.R and Fig3diversest.R. Fig1drmetric.R and Fig4sensitivitysimulation.R perform DR metric analyses and simulations related to respective figures.
